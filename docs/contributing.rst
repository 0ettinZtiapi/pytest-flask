Contributing
============

Found a bug? Have an issue?
---------------------------

The fastest way to get feedback on contributions/bugs is create a `GitHub
issue`_ or catch me on `Twitter`_.


Code syntax and conventions
---------------------------

We try to conform to `PEP8`_ as much as possible. Make sure that your code as
well.


Where are the tests?
--------------------

Good that you're asking. The repository test suite is located in ``tests``
directory. Makefile defines a target to run them::

    make test

Ensure the all tests are passed before submit a pull request.
